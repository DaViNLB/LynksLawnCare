# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

Your code is ready, but let's diagnose why deployment isn't working.

## ✅ Status Check - What's Working

- **Clean Build**: ✅ Replit banner removed, optimized files ready
- **GitHub Actions**: ✅ Workflow file exists and configured
- **Build Script**: ✅ Executable and tested locally
- **Domain Config**: ✅ CNAME file created for lynkslawncare.com

## 🔍 Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### 1. GitHub Actions Not Running
**Check:** Go to your GitHub repo → **Actions** tab

**If no workflows appear:**
- Your repository might not have the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file
- **Solution**: Ensure you've pushed ALL files including the `.github` folder

**If workflow fails:**
- Look for red ❌ next to the workflow run
- Click on it to see error details
- Common errors and fixes below ⬇️

### 2. Repository Settings Issues
**Check:** GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Pages**

**Required Settings:**
- Source: **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
- Custom domain: **"lynkslawncare.com"**
- If you see "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

### 3. Branch Name Mismatch
**Check:** Your default branch name

**If your main branch is NOT called "main":**
```yaml
# Update .github/workflows/deploy.yml line 5:
branches: [ main ]  ← Change to your branch name (master, etc.)
```

### 4. Missing Repository Permissions
**Check:** GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**

**Required Permissions:**
- Workflow permissions: **"Read and write permissions"**
- Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests: **✅ Checked**

### 5. DNS/Domain Issues
**After successful deployment, if custom domain doesn't work:**

**Check DNS at your domain registrar:**
```dns
# These A records must exist:
@ → 185.199.108.153
@ → 185.199.109.153  
@ → 185.199.110.153
@ → 185.199.111.153

# CNAME record:
www → [your-github-username].github.io
```

**Test DNS propagation:**
- Use: https://dnschecker.org
- Search for: lynkslawncare.com
- Should show GitHub's IP addresses

## 🚀 Quick Fix Checklist

1. **Verify all files are pushed:**
   ```
   ✅ .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ✅ static-deploy.sh
   ✅ package.json
   ✅ All client/ and server/ files
   ```

2. **Check repository settings:**
   - Pages source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Custom domain: "lynkslawncare.com"
   - Actions permissions: "Read and write"

3. **Monitor the deployment:**
   - Go to Actions tab after pushing
   - Watch the workflow run
   - Check for any error messages

4. **Test the GitHub Pages URL first:**
   - Your site should work at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`
   - If this works, the issue is DNS-related
   - If this doesn't work, the issue is build-related

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

**Tell me:**
1. What you see in the GitHub **Actions** tab (any workflows? any errors?)
2. What your GitHub **Pages** settings show (source type, custom domain status)
3. Any error messages you're seeing

I can then provide specific fixes for your exact situation!
