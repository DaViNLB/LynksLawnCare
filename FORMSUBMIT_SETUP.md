# Free Email Notifications Setup Guide

This system uses FormSubmit.co to send free email notifications to your business email when customers fill out booking and contact forms.

## How It Works

**FormSubmit.co** is a completely free service that:
- Requires no signup or API keys
- Forwards form submissions directly to your email
- Supports HTML formatting and attachments
- Has no monthly limits for basic usage

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Test the Integration

1. **Fill out a form on your website** (either booking or contact)
2. **Check your console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸ“§ Sending email notification to: davinlynksservices@gmail.com
   Subject: ðŸŒ± New Booking: [Customer Name] - [Service]
   âœ… Email notification sent successfully
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Email Delivery

**First submission to FormSubmit requires verification:**

1. **Submit your first form** through your website
2. **Check your email** (davinlynksservices@gmail.com) for a verification email from FormSubmit
3. **Click the verification link** to activate the service
4. **Submit another form** to test that emails are now being delivered

### Step 3: Customize Email Format (Optional)

The current setup sends emails with:
- **Subject**: Clear identification of booking vs contact
- **Formatted content**: All customer details in an easy-to-read format
- **Direct links**: Clickable phone numbers and email addresses

## Backup Logging

Even if email delivery fails, all notifications are logged to your server console, so you won't miss any customer inquiries.

## Alternative Free Options

If FormSubmit doesn't work for your needs, here are other free alternatives:

1. **Netlify Forms** - If hosting on Netlify
2. **EmailJS** - Free tier: 200 emails/month
3. **Formspree** - Free tier: 50 submissions/month
4. **Google Forms** - Unlimited, but requires manual setup

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Emails?

1. **Check spam folder** - FormSubmit emails might be filtered
2. **Verify email address** - Ensure davinlynksservices@gmail.com is correct
3. **Complete verification** - First submission requires email verification
4. **Check console logs** - Server logs show if notifications are being sent

### Testing the System

You can test by:
1. Filling out the booking form on your website
2. Filling out the contact form
3. Checking server logs for email notification status
4. Checking your email inbox (and spam folder)

## Security Features

FormSubmit includes:
- **Spam protection** built-in
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **No data storage** - emails are forwarded, not stored
- **HTTPS encryption** for all submissions

## Cost

**Completely FREE** - No limits, no signup required, no credit card needed.

The system will automatically send you email notifications whenever someone:
- Books an appointment through your website
- Sends a message through your contact form

This gives you immediate notification of new business inquiries without any ongoing costs.
