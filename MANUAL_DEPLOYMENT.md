# 🚀 Simple Manual GitHub Pages Deployment

Since GitHub Actions is having permission issues, here's a reliable manual approach to get your website live:

## ✅ Option 1: Manual Branch Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Build Your Website Locally
1. In your Replit console, run: `node build-github-pages.js`
2. Verify the build succeeded (should see "✅ Build complete!")

### Step 2: Create gh-pages Branch
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the branch dropdown (usually says "main")
3. Type "gh-pages" and click "Create branch: gh-pages"

### Step 3: Upload Files to gh-pages Branch
1. Switch to the new "gh-pages" branch
2. Delete any existing files in that branch
3. Upload ALL files from your `dist/public/` folder:
   - index.html
   - 404.html
   - CNAME
   - .nojekyll
   - assets/ folder (with all CSS, JS, images)

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: "gh-pages" / (root)
4. Custom domain: "lynkslawncare.com"
5. Check "Enforce HTTPS"

## ✅ Option 2: New Repository Method

If the above doesn't work, create a clean deployment:

### Step 1: Create New Repository
1. Create new GitHub repository: `lynkslawncare-website`
2. Make it public
3. Don't initialize with README

### Step 2: Upload Built Files
1. Build locally: `node build-github-pages.js`
2. Upload all files from `dist/public/` to the new repo
3. Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from branch" → main

### Step 3: Configure Domain
1. Set custom domain: "lynkslawncare.com"
2. Update your DNS to point to the new repository

## 🌐 Expected Result

Once deployed, your website will have:
- Professional Lynks Lawn Care design
- Working contact and booking forms (emails to davinlynksservices@gmail.com)
- Form validation with red error indicators
- Google Maps integration
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Fast loading (optimized 382KB bundle)

## 📧 DNS Configuration Reminder

For lynkslawncare.com to work, add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

```
A Records:
@ → 185.199.108.153
@ → 185.199.109.153
@ → 185.199.110.153
@ → 185.199.111.153

CNAME Record:
www → [your-github-username].github.io
```

Your website files are perfect - this manual method bypasses the GitHub Actions permission issues!
