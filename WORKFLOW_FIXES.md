# ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow Fixed!

I've resolved the workflow errors you were seeing. Here's what was fixed:

## 🔧 Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Build Script Problems**
- **Issue**: Shell script permissions causing failures
- **Fix**: Switched to reliable Node.js build script (`build-static.js`)
- **Result**: More compatible across different GitHub runners

### 2. **Branch Name Issues** 
- **Issue**: Workflow only worked with `main` branch
- **Fix**: Added support for both `main` and `master` branches
- **Result**: Works regardless of your default branch name

### 3. **Missing Permissions**
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions lacked proper permissions for Pages deployment
- **Fix**: Added explicit permissions for `contents`, `pages`, and `id-token`
- **Result**: Can now deploy to GitHub Pages successfully

### 4. **Manual Deployment Option**
- **Added**: `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- **Benefit**: You can manually trigger deployment from GitHub Actions tab

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Push these fixes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Go to Actions tab** - you should see a new workflow run
3. **Watch for green checkmarks** ✅ instead of red X's ❌
4. **Manually trigger if needed** - "Run workflow" button in Actions tab

## 🎯 What to Expect:

- **Build time**: ~2-3 minutes for the workflow to complete
- **Live site**: Should be accessible at your GitHub Pages URL immediately after
- **Custom domain**: lynkslawncare.com will work once DNS propagates

Your website is now ready for successful deployment!
