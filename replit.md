- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Data Flow

1. **Service Discovery**: Users browse services and pricing through the homepage
2. **Price Calculation**: Interactive pricing calculator provides estimates based on service type and property size
3. **Booking Creation**: Users submit booking requests through the booking form
4. **Payment Processing**: Bookings redirect to Stripe checkout for payment completion
5. **Contact Management**: Separate contact form for general inquiries

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend builds to `dist/public` directory
- Backend bundles to `dist/index.js` with ESBuild
- Static asset serving in production mode

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Vite dev server with Express API
- Production: Compiled Express server serving static React build
- Database: Environment-based PostgreSQL connection

### Development Workflow
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build`: Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run db:push`: Push database schema changes via Drizzle

The application follows a standard full-stack pattern with clear separation between frontend presentation, backend API logic, and data persistence layers. The architecture supports easy scaling and maintenance while providing a robust foundation for the lawn care business operations.
